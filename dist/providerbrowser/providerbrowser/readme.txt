<h2>Welcome to the Provider Browser. </h2>

This is a testing-program, implementing the idea of having a dynamic
browser/file manager-interface, build from plain xml-files and images. It can be
used to test new browser and file manager interfaces. 
It is not finished, but it works very well and quite stable imho.<br />
<br />
With the Viewers package, files are viewable in the file explorer-part. Before installing the viewers, put the vcl50.zip in your Windows directory.
<br />
To get it to work: just install the setup program. A link will be on your desktop
